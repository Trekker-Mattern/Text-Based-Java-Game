# Possible ways to go

1. Create a monster with a set level
    - Use that set level to allocate points to each category depending on what their attributes are
        - ie. Fast monster gets 50% of points into speed
    - Possibly Use a set level to allocate a  certain value to each attribute **could be easiest and would make the most sense**

    - **Cons**:
        - Rebuild the system a little bit
        - Possibly break how attacking and things like that work
        - Possibly limit expandability
    - **Pros**:
        - Makes the most sense
        - Fairly easy to accomplish

2. Create a monster based on attributes and get a level value based on the attributes
    - **Cons**:
        - Way way fucking harder
        - Makes less sense
    - **Pros**:
        - Already built that way a little bit

## --- TODO AFTER ---

**MONSTER WEAKNESSES** - THIS WOULD BE SO COOL TO DO -- or at least to set up
